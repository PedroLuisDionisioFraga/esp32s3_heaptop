/**
 * @file heaptop.h
 * @brief htop-like heap and task monitor for ESP-IDF, driven over the serial console.
 *
 * Threading model:
 *   - heaptop_init() starts one low-priority sampler task. It is the only code
 *     that touches heaptop's internal state; it never allocates after init, so
 *     it does not disturb the heap it measures.
 *   - Every sample is published under a mutex; heaptop_get_snapshot() copies
 *     the latest one. Readers never see a half-written sample.
 *   - heaptop_console_register() adds the `ht` command to esp_console. Its
 *     subcommands run in the console task.
 *
 * Singleton: one heaptop instance per application.
