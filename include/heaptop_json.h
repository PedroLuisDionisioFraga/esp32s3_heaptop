/**
 * @file heaptop_json.h
 * @brief One snapshot as a single JSON document, for a web UI or any HTTP/MQTT client (pure, host-testable).
 *
 * heaptop_get_snapshot() copies the latest sample; heaptop_json_snapshot() writes that copy out. The field names
 * are those of the stream protocol (see the README), so one parser serves both. Sizes are bytes, `*10` fields are
 * percent x 10, times are milliseconds of uptime, and `null` means the data source is disabled or the region does
 * not exist.
 *
 * Nothing is allocated. The text is built in a small buffer on the caller's stack and handed to a sink in chunks,
 * so it suits a task with a small stack and does not disturb the heap it reports on.
 *
 * Document layout (keys in this order):
 *   ht, seq, t_ms, since_ms, period_ms, dt_ms, self_us, features,
 *   cpu10 (per core, or null without run-time stats),
 *   regions {internal, dma, psram}: total, free, min, largest, frag10, used_blocks, free_blocks (or null),
 *   failures (or null without the failed-allocation callback), alerts (names of the active alerts),
 *   limits {dram_free_min, dram_largest_min, frag_pct_max, psram_free_min, stack_hwm_min, task_growth}
 *     when @p limits is given,
 *   trend {len, internal_free[], internal_largest[], psram_free[] when PSRAM exists} with HEAPTOP_JSON_TRENDS,
 *   tasks [{name, state, prio, core, cpu10, hwm, and heap, peak, psram, growth, leak only with task tracking}]
 *     and tasks_truncated with HEAPTOP_JSON_TASKS.
